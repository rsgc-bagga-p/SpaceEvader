# SpaceEvader

- IOS Application for finding empty spaces on campus to work
- Data is pushed to the cloud from the Telus IoT development board and then pulled from the ios application
- Data is stored in a NoSQL database by Azure (cosmosDB)
- Currently, map view is shown but due to issues, pulling from the database still doesnt work
